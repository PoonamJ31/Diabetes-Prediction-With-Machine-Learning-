# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning-based system to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic medical data. It uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction capabilities.

## 📊 Overview

- 🎯 **Goal**: Predict diabetes diagnosis (positive or negative) using patient health metrics.
- 📚 **Dataset**: [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- 🧠 **Techniques**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and more
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**, **pandas** – Data handling
- **scikit-learn** – ML models and metrics
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn** – Visualization
